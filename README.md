This package includes functions helping with common tasks during EDA stage of a data science project

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ datascience_eda
```

## Features

- The function `explore_clustering` fits K-Means and DBScan clustering algorithms on the dataset along with displaying Elbow and Silhouette Score plots. It returns a dictionary with each key being name of the clustering algorithm and the value being a list of plots generated by the models

- The function `explore_text_columns` performs exploratory data analysis of text features. It prints the summary statistics of character length and word count. It also plots the word cloud, distributions of character length, word count and polarity and subjectivity scores. Bar charts of top n stopwords, top n words other than stopwords, top n bigrams, sentiments, name entities and part of speech tags are displayed as well. This returns a list of plot objects

- The function `explore_numeric_columns` creates common exploratory analysis visualizations on numeric columns like heatmap showing correlation coefficient (pearson, kendall or spearman) between all numeric columns, histograms of user specified numeric columns and scatterplot matrix plots for all numeric columns or columns specified by the user. This returns a list of plot objects

- The function `explore_categorical_columns` performs EDA of categorical features. It creates and returns a dataframe containing column names, corresponding unique categories, counts of null values, percentages of null values and most frequent categories. And it also displays countplots of user specified categorical columns.
